# ensemble-thresholds
Code and scripts for assessing ensemble spread for different performance thresholds

These are preliminary scripts for an ongoing study exploring the relationships between performance metric choice, acceptable model perfomance thresholds and resulting simulation ensembles.

Currently only contains the pseudo-simulation generator which systematcially adds error into an observed time series

Work in progress: stay posted as more of the code is released and results are published
